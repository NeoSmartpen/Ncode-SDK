### About Ncode™: service development guide 

‘Natural Handwriting’ technology based on Ncode™(Microscopic data patterns containing various types of data) is a handwriting stroke recovery technology that digitizes paper coordinates obtained by optical pen devices such as Neo smartpen. The coordinates then can be used to store handwriting stroke information, analyzed to extract meaning based on user preferences and serve as the basis for many other types of services.
